### For increasing spatial resolution, do:
#### Stage 1A

Initial inter-autoradiograph alignment *OR* Combine warped 2D autoradiograph sections into a volume. 

Autoradiograph segmentation

3D alignment to MRI

Resample MRI GM volume to autoradiograph space

#### Stage 1B

2D non-linear alignment of autoadiographs to MRI GM volume warped to autoradiograph space

Return to Stage 2 if high resolution level has not been reached.

### Stage 2

Surface-based interpolation
