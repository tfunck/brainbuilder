abstract = {Quantitative autoradiography is a powerful method for studying brain function by the determination of blood flow, glucose utilization, or transport of essential nutrients. Autoradiographic images contain vast amounts of potentially useful information, but conventional analyses can practically sample the data at only a small number of points arbitrarily chosen by the experimenter to represent discrete brain structures. To use image data more fully, computer methods for its acquisition, storage, quantitative analysis, and display are required. We have developed a system of computer programs that performs these tasks and has the following features: 1) editing and analysis of single images using interactive graphics, 2) an automatic image alignment algorithm that places images in register with one another using only the mathematical properties of the images themselves, 3) the calculation of mean images from equivalent images in different experimental serial image sets, 4) the calculation of difference images (e.g., experiment-minus-control) with the option to display only differences estimated to be statistically significant, and 5) the display of serial image metabolic maps reconstructed in three dimensions using a high-speed computer graphics system.},

In this way the relationship between anatomy and specific binding, Kd and Bmax, can be appreciated. These experiments have resulted in image representations of specific flunitrazepam binding, Kd and Bmax. The images retain the anatomic localization inherent in the original autoradiogram and hence make these parameters amenable to visual survey. Binding constants were consistent with data presented elsewhere in the literature. The image of Bmax showed regional heterogeneity. Kd, on the other hand, was relatively homogeneous. These results demonstrate a means by which autoradiographic binding experiments can be extended to saturation studies without significant loss of data.},

abstract = {Functional activity of brain can be defined as the change in physiological activity that accompanies change in behavior. Although the precise relationship between such coupled activity is still being explored, autoradiographic methods for measuring brain blood flow, metabolism and receptor ligand densities have advanced to the point where it is possible to survey the entire brain of an animal for such changes. These developments offer the opportunity for studying brain as a whole—that is, for surveying the entire brain to identify the sites where changes in blood flow, metabolism or receptor chemistry occur with a particular behavior. The development of computer-based image analysis systems offer the possibility for visualizing such holistic brain function. We identified 4 steps which must be accomplished in developing a three-dimensional (3D) display for studying brain function. This paper describes the development and implementation of procedures for these 4 steps. (1) Sectioning and digitizing representative tissue (e.g. autoradiograms, histology, histochemistry) with an adequate sampling frequency. (2) Alignment and reconstruction of the components which make up the whole brain so that the original shape and orientation prior to sectioning is maintained. (3) Projection and surface generation of a 3D model where the shading of the surface is mathematically dependent on the location of light source(s) and the viewer. (4) Localization and quantification of planar cuts through the 3D model. Density data which reference the original autoradiograms are displayed along the exposed surface of the designated plane. The final presentation of data once these 4 steps are completed allows for the identification and visualization of changes in functional activity within the whole brain.},

abstract = {Autoradiography can generate large quantities of information related to brain metabolism, blood flow, transport across the blood-brain barrier, neurotransmitter-receptor binding and other aspects of brain function. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of digitized autoradiograms provides a mechanism for efficient analysis of function, in detail, over the entire brain. 3D reconstructions of the mean and variance can be obtained by superimposing data from similar experiments, leading ultimately to 3D reconstructions of differences with statistical tests of significance. Image registration is essential for reconstruction, and this article reports two independent algorithms for coronal image alignment that have been successfully implemented in computer programs. The first algorithm superimposes the centroids and principal axes of serial images; the extent and direction of the translation and rotation required for each image is obtained from an analysis of the inertia matrix of that image. The second algorithm matches the edges of structure features in serial-adjacent images, from analyses of the cross-correlation function of each pair of adjacent images. The cross-correlation method requires a great deal more computation than the principal axes method, but it can align damaged sections not reliably treated by the principal axes method. The methods are described in detail, and a quantitative assessment of the registration of non-identical images is considered. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The distribution of dopamine D1 receptors has been determined in post mortem human brain tissues using in vitro receptor autoradiography, with ([3H]N-methyl) SCH 23390 as ligand. The highest densities of dopamine D1 sites were seen in the nucleus caudates, putamen, globus pallidus pars medialis and substantia nigra. Intermediate densities were associated with the amygdala, mammillary bodies, cerebral cortex and CA1. The remaining part of the hippocampus as well as the diencephalon, brainstem and cerebellum contained low levels of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites. The distribution of D1 receptors in the human brain closely resembles that reported for the rat brain. In addition, there was a good correlation between the anatomical localization of D1 sites and the distribution of dopaminergic nerve terminals in the central nervous system. The densities of D1 receptors in the human brain were observed to markedly decrease with age during the first decades of life. However, no further modifications were found beyond the age of 40 years. We did not observe any significant influence of other parameters such as gender and post mortem delay in our samples.},

abstract = {An algorithm for the alignment of stained serial sections without the support of artificial landmarks is described. Four-hundred-thirty serial sections of the rabbit hippocampal region were digitized, and computer-based alignment was performed without use of artificial markers, resulting in a consistent matrix. Following proper filtration, artificial sections were cut through the matrix. In a second experiment every second image was deleted and reconstructed by interpolation with a minor loss of biological information. In a third experiment every second image was deleted and the rest of the images were 'disordered', realigned and the missing planes reconstructed by interpolation. Under these circumstances the matrix was reconstructed with some loss of information. These results may widen the limits of 3-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction, as routine histological preparations normally include only every second or every third section without artificial landmarks. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Quantitative autoradiography is a powerful radioisotopic-imaging method for neuroscientists to study local cerebral blood flow and glucose-metabolic rate at rest, in response to physiologic activation of the visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor systems, and in pathologic conditions. Most autoradiographic studies analyze glucose utilization and blood flow in two-dimensional (2D) coronal sections. With modern digital computer and image-processing techniques, a large number of closely spaced coronal sections can be stacked appropriately to form a three-dimensional (3D) image. 3D autoradiography allows investigators to observe cerebral sections and surfaces from any viewing angle. A fundamental problem in 3D reconstruction is the alignment (registration) of the coronal sections. A new alignment method based on disparity analysis is presented, which can overcome many of the difficulties encountered by previous methods. The disparity analysis method can deal with asymmetric, damaged, or tilted coronal sections under the same general framework, and it can be used to match coronal sections of different sizes and shapes. Experimental results on alignment and 3D reconstruction are presented.},

This paper describes the algorithms used for five different registration methods; frequency domain cross-correlation, spatial domain cross-correlation, principal axes/ center of mass, fiducials and manual. These methods were compared in terms of their accuracy, efficiency and application with several different data types including different species and modalities. The underlying mathematical bases for each also are presented and compared. The results of the comparisons showed that image quality influenced the behavior of all methods. Images of the blockface provide an excellent reference for subsequent registration. These results also suggest that the statistical performance of various methods is not a reliable metric when distant and different images are registered. Visual comparisons by image overlap and pixel differencing illustrated that some methods are more prone to rotational error than others, especially when repeated pairwise registrations were computed along the rostral/caudal axis.},

abstract = {An exact registration of magnetic resonance images (MRI) with histological sections is impeded by local deformations resulting from histological preparation procedures. Therefore, it is desirable to know the probability density function of spatial deformations in order to estimate optimal global least-square transformation parameters from suitable landmarks. For this reason, the statistics of deformations is investigated. It is shown analytically that the frequency of occurence of the absolute geometrical differences (deformations) are Rayleigh-Bessel distributed for anisotropic histological preparation procedures and Rayleigh distributed in the case of isotropic procedures. The probabilistic analysis is given in conjunction with an iterative optimization technique in order to ensure that the probability density function is within a threshold required for the application to experimental data. The application of the analytical model is investigated with real data. It is shown with this data that the extent of deformations varies with the size of the histological section. An individual threshold can be selected on the basis of a Rayleigh-function restricting local corrections to small parts of the image. Thus, global misalignment in each section can be avoided, resulting in an improved 3-D reconstruction of the volume, i.e., the transitions from one section to the next are more continuous. {\textcopyright} 1995 IEEE},

abstract = {This study examined the densitometric and topographic detail of high resolution 3D digital postmortem cryosectioned brain images. Anatomic image data and histology from cryosectioned human brain were compared to in vivo MRI for the ability to delineate neuroanatomic structure. 3D surface reconstructions in the Talairach and Tournoux atlas (“Co-planar stereotaxic atlas of the human brain”, Thieme, New York, 1988) coordinate system enabled morphometric comparisons for a representative sample of neuroanatomic structures. Spatial resolution of cryosection images averaged 200 and 170 microns/pixel for whole head and brain, respectively, and 40 microns/pixel for isolated brain regions. Anatomic detail was far superior to MRI, particularly in deep subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia and in mesencephalic nuclei and tracts. Digital repositioning in the Talairach coordinate system enabled efficient structure localization and morphometric comparison. Histology from collected tissue sections provided cytologic detail that could be mapped to its approximate 3D context. This approach permits comprehensive morphometric analyses necessary for an anatomic framework to a digital atlas of the human brain.},

abstract = {An automated multimodal warping based on mutual information metric (MI) as a mapping cost function is demonstrated. Mutual information (I) is calculated from a two-dimensional (2D) gray scale histogram of an image pair, and MI (=-I) provides a matching cost function which can be effective in registration of two-or three-dimensional data sets independent of modality. Most histological image data, though information rich and high resolution, present nonlinear deformations due to the specimen sectioning and need reconstitution into deformation-corrected volumes prior to geometric mapping to an anatomical volume for spatial analyses. Section alignment via automatic 2D registrations employing MI as a global cost function and thin-plate- spline (TPS) warping is applied to deoxy-D[14C]glucose autoradiographic image slices of a rat brain with video reference images of the uncut block face to reconstitute a cerebral glucose metabolic volume data. Unlike the traditional feature-based TPS warping algorithms, initial control points are defined independently from feature landmarks. Registration quality using automated multimodal image warping is validated by comparing MIs of the image pair registered by automated affine registration and manual warping method. The MI proves to be a robust objective matching cost function effective for automatic multimodality warping for 2D data sets and can be readily applied to volume registrations.},

The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal. Nonlinear transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological data were applied to the segmented structure contours.

This paper describes a protocol that matches a series of stained histological slices of a baboon brain with an anatomical MRI scan of the same subject using an intermediate 3D-consistent volume of "blockface" photographs taken during the sectioning process. Each stained histological section of the baboon brain was first registered to its corresponding blockface photograph using a novel "hemi-rigid" transformation. This piecewise rigid 2D transformation was specifically adapted to the registration of slices which contained both hemispheres. Subsenquently, to correct the global 3D deformations of the brain caused by histological preparation and fixation, a 3D elastic transformation was estimated between the blockface volume and the MRI data. This 3D elastic transformation was then applied to the histological volume previously aligned using the hemi-rigid method to complete the registration of the series of stained histological slices with the MRI data. We assessed the efficacy of our method by evaluating the quality of matching of anatomical features as well as the difference of volume measurements between the MRI and the histological images. Two complete baboon brains (with the exception of cerebellum) were successfully processed using our protocol. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Thanks to this technique, it becomes possible to restore the spatial consistency of the brain and to match accurately histological slices with an in vivo medical device image such as an MRI or a PET scan. This is of high interest since it allows direct comparison between the histology, often considered as the gold standard in terms of information, and the same medical devices used in clinical routine to image human patients. Thanks to the similarity of their brain with humans and the disease models widely developed for them, non-human primates are privileged species to benefit from this possibility of 3D analysis and in vivo - post mortem correlation.

abstract = {Functional neurosurgery relies on robust localization of the subcortical target structures, which cannot be visualized directly with current clinically available in-vivo imaging techniques. Therefore, one has still to rely on an indirect approach, by transferring detailed histological maps onto the patient's individual brain images. In contrast to macroscopic MRI atlases, which often represent the average of a population, each stack of sections, which a stereotactic atlas provides, is based on a single specimen. In addition to this bias, the anatomy is displayed with a highly anisotropic resolution, leading to topological ambiguities and limiting the accuracy of geometric reconstruction. In this work we construct an unbiased, high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the thalamic structures, representing the average of several stereotactically oriented histological maps. We resolve the topological ambiguity by combining the information provided by histological data from different stereotactic directions. Since the stacks differ not only in geometrical detail provided, but also due to inter-individual variability, we adopt an iterative approach for reconstructing the mean model. Starting with a reconstruction from a single stack of sections, we iteratively register the current reference model onto the available data and reconstruct a refined mean three-dimensional model. The results show that integration of multiple stereotactic anatomical data to produce an unbiased, mean model of the thalamic nuclei and their subdivisions is feasible and that the integration reduces problems of atlas reconstruction inherent to histological stacks to a large extent. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Functional brain imaging and neurosurgery in subcortical areas often requires visualization of brain nuclei beyond the resolution of current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. We present techniques used to create: (1) a lower resolution 3D atlas, based on the Schaltenbrand and Wahren print atlas, which was integrated into a stereotactic neurosurgery planning and visualization platform (VIPER); and (2) a higher resolution 3D atlas derived from a single set of manually segmented histological slices containing nuclei of the basal ganglia, thalamus, basal forebrain, and medial temporal lobe. Both atlases were integrated to a canonical MRI (Colin27) from a young male participant by manually identifying homologous landmarks. The lower resolution atlas was then warped to fit the MRI based on the identified landmarks. A pseudo-MRI representation of the high-resolution atlas was created, and a non-linear transformation was calculated in order to match the atlas to the template MRI. The atlas can then be warped to match the anatomy of Parkinson's disease surgical candidates by using 3D automated non-linear deformation methods. By way of functional validation of the atlas, the location of the sensory thalamus was correlated with stereotactic intraoperative physiological data. The position of subthalamic electrode positions in patients with Parkinson's disease was also evaluated in the atlas-integrated MRI space. Finally, probabilistic maps of subthalamic stimulation electrodes were developed, in order to allow group analysis of the location of contacts associated with the best motor outcomes. We have therefore developed, and are continuing to validate, a high-resolution computerized MRI-integrated 3D histological atlas, which is useful in functional neurosurgery, and for functional and anatomical studies of the human basal ganglia, thalamus, and basal forebrain.},

We note that the quality of a reconstructed volume is usually assessed by considering the smoothness of some reconstructed structures of interest (e.g., the gray-white matter surfaces in brain images). Here we propose to use smoothness as a means to drive the reconstruction process itself. From a pair-wise rigid reconstruction of the 2-D slices, we first extract the boundaries of structures of interest. Those are then smoothed with a min-max curvature flow confined to the 2-D planes in which the slices lie. Finally, for each slice, we estimate a linear or flexible transformation from the sparse displacement field computed from the flow, which we apply to the original 2-D slices to obtain a smooth volume. In addition, we present a co-occurrence matrix-based technique to quantify the smoothness of reconstructed volumes. We discuss and validate the application of both our reconstruction approach and the smoothness measure on synthetic examples as well as real histological data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and examination of tissue at microscopic resolution have significant potential to enhance the study of both normal and disease processes, particularly those involving structural changes or those in which the spatial relationship of disease features is important. Although other methods exist for studying tissue in 3D, using conventional histopathological features has significant advantages because it allows for conventional histopathological staining and interpretation techniques. Until now, its use has not been routine in research because of the technical difficulty in constructing 3D tissue models. We describe a novel system for 3D histological reconstruction, integrating whole-slide imaging (virtual slides), image serving, registration, and visualization into one user-friendly package. It produces high-resolution 3D reconstructions with minimal user interaction and can be used in a histopathological laboratory without input from computing specialists. It uses a novel method for slice-to-slice image registration using automatic registration algorithms custom designed for both virtual slides and histopathological images. This system has been applied to {\textgreater}300 separate 3D volumes from eight different tissue types, using a total of 5500 virtual slides comprising 1.45 TB of primary image data. Qualitative and quantitative metrics for the accuracy of 3D reconstruction are provided, with measured registration accuracy approaching 120 $\mu$m for a 1-cm piece of tissue. Both 3D tissue volumes and generated 3D models are presented for four demonstrator cases.},

abstract = {Surgical resection of epileptic foci is a typical treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, however, accurate pre-operative localization is challenging and often requires invasive sub-dural or intra-cranial electrode placement. The presence of cellular abnormalities in the resected tissue can be used to validate the effectiveness of multi-spectral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in pre-operative foci localization and surgical planning. If successful, these techniques can lead to improved surgical outcomes and less invasive procedures. Towards this goal, a novel pipeline is presented here for post-operative imaging of temporal lobe specimens involving MRI and digital histology, and present and evaluate methods for bringing these images into spatial correspondence. The sparsely-sectioned histology images of resected tissue represents a challenge for 3D reconstruction which we address with a combined 3D and 2D rigid registration algorithm that alternates between slice-based and volume-based registration with the ex-vivo MRI. We also evaluate four methods for non-rigid within-plane registration using both images and fiducials, with the top performing method resulting in a target registration error of 0.87 mm. This work allows for the spatially-local comparison of histology with post-operative MRI and paves the way for eventual registration with pre-operative MRI images. {\textcopyright} 2012 SPIE.},

abstract = {A method is presented for three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse brain from histological sections with the guidance of magnetic resonance images (MRI). A major focus of the method is dealing with sections in which anatomical structures have been separated or distorted as a result of histological processing. Although histology has superb resolution with the ability to discriminate cell types and anatomical structures, misalignment between sections and distortion within sections renders 3D reconstruction of the histology volume simply by stacking 2D sections inadequate. In contrast, MRI preserves the spatial and geometric information about structures at a cost of cellular detail. To utilize the information from MRI in reconstructing volumetric histological data, we developed a procedure consisting of a series of segmentation and registration operations. The method is iterative and first identifies the corresponding MRI slices for each histological section. Piecewise rigid registration is then employed to deal with tissue distortion caused by histological processing. Quantitative validation of the method's accuracy was performed on four reconstructed mouse brains by comparing a set of manually selected anatomical landmarks on pairs of MRI and histological volumes. The procedure is highly automated and amenable to high throughput.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is a neuroanatomical structure that has been widely studied in the context of learning, memory, stress, and neurodegeneration. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus is subdivided into several subfields with intricate morphologies and complex three-dimensional relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated that the identification of different subfields is possible with high-resolution and -contrast image volumes acquired using ex vivo specimens in a small bore 9.4T scanner and, more recently, in vivo, at 7T. In these studies, the neuroanatomical definitions of boundaries between subfields are based upon salient differences in image contrast. Typically, the definition of subfields has not been possible using commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (i.e.: 1.5 or 3T) due to resolution and contrast limitations. To overcome the limited availability of post-mortem specimens and expertise in state-of-the-art high-field imaging, we propose a coupling of MR acquisition and detailed segmentation techniques that allow for the reliable identification of hippocampal anatomy (including subfields). High-resolution and -contrast T1- and T2-weighted image volumes were acquired from 5 volunteers (2 male; 3 female; age range: 29–57, avg. 37) using a clinical research-grade 3T scanner and have final super-sampled isotropic voxel dimensions of 0.3mm. We demonstrate that by using these acquisition techniques, our data results in contrast-to-noise ratios that compare well with high-resolution images acquired with long scan times using post-mortem data at higher field strengths. For the subfields, the cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum/stratum moleculare, and subiculum were all labeled as separate structures. Hippocampal volumes are reported for each of the substructures and the hippocampus as a whole (range for hippocampus: 2456.72–3325.02mm3). Intra-rater reliability of our manual segmentation protocol demonstrates high reliability for the whole hippocampus (mean Dice Kappa of 0.91; range 0.90–0.92) and for each of the subfields (range of Dice Kappas: 0.64–0.83). We demonstrate that our reliability is better than the Dice Kappas produced by simulating the following errors: a translation by a single voxel in all cardinal directions and 1{\%} volumetric shrinkage and expansion. The completed hippocampal atlases are available freely online (info2.camh.net/kf-tigr/index.php/Hippocampus) and can be coupled with novel computational neuroanatomy techniques that will allow for them to be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects, and ultimately be utilized in different analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing effort to analyze the morphometry of hippocampal subfields using both in vivo and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules are challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200$\mu$m spacing and 5$\mu$m slice thickness; stained using the Kluver–Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160$\mu$m isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200$\mu$m isotropic resolution. These 1cm blocks are subsequently co-registered to the MRI of the whole HF. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated as the average displacement error between boundaries manually delineated in both the histology and MRI following the sequential stages of reconstruction. The methods presented and evaluated in this single-subject study can potentially be applied to multiple hippocampal tissue samples in order to construct a histologically informed MRI atlas of the hippocampal formation.},

Structural abnormalities of the microvasculature can impair perfusion and function. Conventional histology provides good spatial resolution with which to evaluate the microvascular structure but affords no 3-dimensional information; this limitation could lead to misinterpretations of the complex microvessel network in health and disease. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an accurate, fully automated 3D histology reconstruction method to visualize the arterioles and venules within the mouse hind-limb. Sections of the tibialis anterior muscle from C57BL/J6 mice (both normal and subjected to femoral artery excision) were reconstructed using pairwise rigid and affine registrations of 5 $\mu$m-thick, paraffin-embedded serial sections digitized at 0.25 $\mu$m/pixel. Low-resolution intensity-based rigid registration was used to initialize the nucleus landmark-based registration, and conventional high-resolution intensity-based registration method. The affine nucleus landmark-based registration was developed in this work and was compared to the conventional affine high-resolution intensity-based registration method. Target registration errors were measured between adjacent tissue sections (pairwise error), as well as with respect to a 3D reference reconstruction (accumulated error, to capture propagation of error through the stack of sections). Accumulated error measures were lower (p {\textless} 0.01) for the nucleus landmark technique and superior vasculature continuity was observed. These findings indicate that registration based on automatic extraction and correspondence of small, homologous landmarks may support accurate 3D histology reconstruction. This technique avoids the otherwise problematic "banana-into-cylinder" effect observed using conventional methods that optimize the pairwise alignment of salient structures, forcing them to be section-orthogonal. T his approach will provide a valuable tool for high-accuracy 3D histology tissue reconstructions for analysis of diseased microvasculature.},

@article{Goubran2015,
abstract = {Background: Advances in MRI have the potential to improve surgical treatment of epilepsy through improved identification and delineation of lesions. However, validation is currently needed to investigate histopathological correlates of these new imaging techniques. The purpose of this work is to develop and evaluate a protocol for deformable image registration of in-vivo to ex-vivo resected brain specimen MRI. This protocol, in conjunction with our previous work on ex-vivo to histology registration, completes a registration pipeline for histology to in-vivo MRI, enabling voxel-based validation of novel and existing MRI techniques with histopathology. New method: A combination of image-based and landmark-based 3D registration was used to register in-vivo MRI and the ex-vivo MRI from patients ( N = 10) undergoing epilepsy surgery. Target registration error (TRE) was used to assess accuracy and the added benefit of deformable registration. Results: A mean TRE of 1.35 ± 0.11 and 1.41 ± 0.33 mm was found for neocortical and hippocampal specimens respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the deformable registration significantly improved the registration accuracy for both specimens. Comparison with existing methods: Image registration of surgically resected brain specimens is a unique application which presents numerous technical challenges and that have not been fully addressed in previous literature. Our computed TRE are comparable to previous attempts tackling similar applications, as registering in-vivo MRI to whole brain or serial histology. Conclusion: The presented registration pipeline finds dense and accurate spatial correspondence between in-vivo MRI and histology and allows for the spatially local and quantitative assessment of pathological correlates in MRI.},

High-resolution multiscale and multimodal 3D models of the brain are essential tools to understand its complex structural and functional organization. Neuroimaging techniques addressing different aspects of brain organization should be integrated in a reference space to enable topographically correct alignment and subsequent analysis of the various datasets and their modalities. The Waxholm Space (http://software.incf.org/software/waxholm-space) is a publicly available 3D coordinate-based standard reference space for the mapping and registration of neuroanatomical data in rodent brains. This paper provides a newly developed pipeline combining imaging and reconstruction steps with a novel registration strategy to integrate new neuroimaging modalities into the Waxholm Space atlas. As a proof of principle, we incorporated large scale high-resolution cyto-, muscarinic M2 receptor, and fiber architectonic images of rat brains into the 3D digital MRI based atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat in Waxholm Space. We describe the whole workflow, from image acquisition to reconstruction and registration of these three modalities into the Waxholm Space rat atlas. The registration of the brain sections into the atlas is performed by using both linear and non-linear transformations. The validity of the procedure is qualitatively demonstrated by visual inspection, and a quantitative evaluation is performed by measurement of the concordance between representative atlas-delineated regions and the same regions based on receptor or fiber architectonic data. This novel approach enables for the first time the generation of 3D reconstructed volumes of nerve fibers and fiber tracts, or of muscarinic M2 receptor density distributions, in an entire rat brain. Additionally, our pipeline facilitates the inclusion of further neuroimaging datasets, e.g., 3D reconstructed volumes of histochemical stainings or of the regional distributions of multiple other receptor types, into the Waxholm Space. Thereby, a multiscale and multimodal rat brain model was created in the Waxholm Space atlas of the rat brain. Since the registration of these multimodal high-resolution datasets into the same coordinate system is an indispensable requisite for multi-parameter analyses, this approach enables combined studies on receptor and cell distributions as well as fiber densities in the same anatomical structures at microscopic scales for the first time.},

abstract = {Traditional histology is the gold standard for tissue studies, but it is intrinsically reliant on two-dimensional (2D) images. Study of volumetric tissue samples such as whole hearts produces a stack of misaligned and distorted 2D images that need to be reconstructed to recover a congruent volume with the original sample's shape. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework called Transformation Diffusion (TD) for stack alignment refinement as a solution to the heat diffusion equation. This general framework does not require contour segmentation, is independent of the registration method used, and is trivially parallelizable. After the first stack sweep, we also replace registration operations by operations in the space of transformations, several orders of magnitude faster and less memory-consuming. Implementing TD with operations in the space of transformations produces our Transformation Diffusion Reconstruction (TDR) algorithm, applicable to general transformations that are closed under inversion and composition. In particular, we provide formulas for translation and affine transformations. We also propose an Approximated TDR (ATDR) algorithm that extends the same principles to tensor-product B-spline transformations. Using TDR and ATDR, we reconstruct a full mouse heart at pixel size 0.92 µm × 0.92 µm, cut 10 µm thick, spaced 20 µm (84G). Our algorithms employ only local information from transformations between neighboring slices, but the TD framework allows theoretical analysis of the refinement as applying a global Gaussian low-pass filter to the unknown stack misalignments. We also show that reconstruction without an external reference produces large shape artifacts in a cardiac specimen while still optimizing slice-to-slice alignment. To overcome this problem, we use a pre-cutting blockface imaging process previously developed by our group that takes advantage of Brewster's angle and a polarizer to capture the outline of only the topmost layer of wax in the block containing embedded tissue for histological sectioning.},

However, radiological-pathological correlations in human brain tissue that detail the relationship between the multi-component diffusion signal and underlying pathology are lacking. We present a nonlinear voxel based two dimensional coregistration method that is useful for matching diffusion signals to quantitative metrics of high resolution histological images. When validated in ex vivo human cortical tissue at a 250×250×500 $\mu$m spatial resolution, the method proved robust in correlations between generalized q-sampling imaging and histologically based white matter fiber orientations, with r=0.94 for the primary fiber direction and r=0.88 for secondary fiber direction in each voxel. Importantly, however, the correlation was substantially worse with reduced spatial resolution or with fiber orientations derived using a diffusion tensor model. Furthermore, we have detailed a quantitative histological metric of white matter fiber integrity termed power coherence capable of distinguishing architecturally complex but intact white matter from disrupted white matter regions. These methods may allow for more sensitive and specific radiological-pathological correlations of neurodegenerative diseases affecting complex gray and white matter.},

abstract = {The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly specific nuclei. Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The 3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas, which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability, robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.},

abstract = {Histology permits the observation of otherwise invisible structures of the internal topography of a specimen. Although it enables the investigation of tissues at a cellular level, it is invasive and breaks topology due to cutting. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was thus introduced to overcome the limitations of single-section studies in a dimensional scope. 3D reconstruction finds its roots in embryology, where it enabled the visualisation of spatial relationships of developing systems and organs, and extended to biomedicine, where the observation of individual, stained sections provided only partial understanding of normal and abnormal tissues. However, despite bringing visual awareness, recovering realistic reconstructions is elusive without prior knowledge about the tissue shape. 3D medical imaging made such structural ground truths available. In addition, combining non-invasive imaging with histology unveiled invaluable opportunities to relate macroscopic information to the underlying microscopic properties of tissues through the establishment of spatial correspondences; image registration is one technique that permits the automation of such a process and we describe reconstruction methods that rely on it. It is thereby possible to recover the original topology of histology and lost relationships, gain insight into what affects the signals used to construct medical images (and characterise them), or build high resolution anatomical atlases. This paper reviews almost three decades of methods for 3D histology reconstruction from serial sections, used in the study of many different types of tissue. We first summarise the process that produces digitised sections from a tissue specimen in order to understand the peculiarity of the data, the associated artefacts and some possible ways to minimise them. We then describe methods for 3D histology reconstruction with and without the help of 3D medical imaging, along with methods of validation and some applications. We finally attempt to identify the trends and challenges that the field is facing, many of which are derived from the cross-disciplinary nature of the problem as it involves the collaboration between physicists, histolopathologists, computer scientists and physicians.},

abstract = {Nonlinear registration of 2D histological sections with corresponding slices of MRI data is a critical step of 3D histology reconstruction algorithms. This registration is difficult due to the large differences in image contrast and resolution, as well as the complex nonrigid deformations and artefacts produced when sectioning the sample and mounting it on the glass slide. It has been shown in brain MRI registration that better spatial alignment across modalities can be obtained by synthesising one modality from the other and then using intra-modality registration metrics, rather than by using information theory based metrics to solve the problem directly. However, such an approach typically requires a database of aligned images from the two modalities, which is very difficult to obtain for histology and MRI. Here, we overcome this limitation with a probabilistic method that simultaneously solves for deformable registration and synthesis directly on the target images, without requiring any training data. The method is based on a probabilistic model in which the MRI slice is assumed to be a contrast-warped, spatially deformed version of the histological section. We use approximate Bayesian inference to iteratively refine the probabilistic estimate of the synthesis and the registration, while accounting for each other's uncertainty. Moreover, manually placed landmarks can be seamlessly integrated in the framework for increased performance and robustness. Experiments on a synthetic dataset of MRI slices show that, compared with mutual information based registration, the proposed method makes it possible to use a much more flexible deformation model in the registration to improve its accuracy, without compromising robustness. Moreover, our framework also exploits information in manually placed landmarks more efficiently than mutual information: landmarks constrain the deformation field in both methods, but in our algorithm, it also has a positive effect on the synthesis – which further improves the registration. We also show results on two real, publicly available datasets: the Allen and BigBrain atlases. In both of them, the proposed method provides a clear improvement over mutual information based registration, both qualitatively (visual inspection) and quantitatively (registration error measured with pairs of manually annotated landmarks).},

abstract = {Three-dimensional atlases of subcortical brain structures are valuable tools to reference anatomy in neuroscience and neurology. For instance, they can be used to study the position and shape of the three most common deep brain stimulation (DBS) targets, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), internal part of the pallidum (GPi) and ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) in spatial relationship to DBS electrodes. Here, we present a composite atlas based on manual segmentations of a multimodal high resolution brain template, histology and structural connectivity. In a first step, four key structures were defined on the template itself using a combination of multispectral image analysis and manual segmentation. Second, these structures were used as anchor points to coregister a detailed histological atlas into standard space. Results show that this approach significantly improved coregistration accuracy over previously published methods. Finally, a sub-segmentation of STN and GPi into functional zones was achieved based on structural connectivity. The result is a composite atlas that defines key nuclei on the template itself, fills the gaps between them using histology and further subdivides them using structural connectivity. We show that the atlas can be used to segment DBS targets in single subjects, yielding more accurate results compared to priorly published atlases. The atlas will be made publicly available and constitutes a resource to study DBS electrode localizations in combination with modern neuroimaging methods.},
